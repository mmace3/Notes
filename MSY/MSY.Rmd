Notes on deriving the formula for maximum sustainable yield.


# Population Model

Suppose a population grows according to the logistic growth model,

$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right)$$
where $r$ is the intrinsic rate of increase of the population, $N$ is the number of individuals alive in the population, and $K$ is the maximum population size, also called the carrying capacity. Now we include the effects of harvesting individuals, which removes them from the population,

$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right) - H$$

where $H$ is the amount of individuals removed. This can be represented as a product of the instantaneous fishing mortality rate $F$ and $N$,

$$ H = FN $$

so that our model now can be written as

$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right) - FN$$
