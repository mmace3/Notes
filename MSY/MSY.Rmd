Notes on deriving the formula for maximum sustainable yield.


# Population Model

Suppose a population grows according to the logistic growth model,

$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right)$$
where $r$ is the intrinsic rate of increase of the population, $N$ is the number of individuals alive in the population, and $K$ is the maximum population size, also called the carrying capacity. Now we include the effects of harvesting individuals, which removes them from the population,

$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right) - H$$

where $H$ is the amount of individuals removed. This can be represented as a product of the instantaneous fishing mortality rate $F$ and $N$,

$$ H = FN $$

so that our model now can be written as

$$ \frac{dN}{dt} = rN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right) - FN \text{.}$$

To determine the equilibrium points for equation # we set $\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$ and solve for N,

\begin{align*}
rN \left( 1 - \frac{N}{K} \right) - FN &= 0 \\
rN - rN\frac{N}{K} - FN &= 0 \\
N(r - r\frac{N}{K} - F ) &= 0
\end{align*}

and we see there are two equilibria when

$$ N = 0 $$

or

$$ r - r\frac{N}{K} - F = 0 \text{.}$$

Solving the second equlibrium for $N$ we find the equilibrium population abundance $N_{e}$,

\begin{align*}
r - r\frac{N}{K} - F &= 0 \\
r - F &= r\frac{N}{K} \\
\frac{N}{K} &= \frac{r - F}{r} \\
N_{e} &= K \left( \frac{r - F}{r} \right) = K \left( \frac{r}{r} - \frac{F}{r} \right) = K \left( 1 - \frac{F}{r} \right)
\end{align*}

If we define yield $Y$, or the number of fish harvested, as $Y = FN$ then the equilibrium yield is

$$ Y = FN_{e} \text{.}$$
Substituting equation # into equation #, taking the derivative with respect to F, and then solving for F will give us the equilibrium fishing mortality rate $F_{e}$. First we substitute equation # into equation # and take the derivative with respect to F,

\begin{align*}
\frac{dY}{dF} =  \frac{d}{dF} Y &= \frac{d}{dF} F \left( K \left( 1 - \frac{F}{r} \right) \right)  \\ 
&= \frac{d}{dF} F \left(K - \frac{FK}{r} \right) \\
&= \frac{d}{dF} FK - \frac{F^{2}K}{r} \\
&= \frac{d}{dF} FK - \frac{d}{dF} \frac{F^{2}K}{r} \\
&= K - \frac{2FK}{r} \\
&= K \left(1 - \frac{2F}{r} \right)
\end{align*}

Then we set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for F to get the equilibrium fishing mortality rate,

$$ \frac{dY}{dT} = K - \frac{2FK}{r} = 0 \\$$ 
and then

\begin{align*}
\frac{2FK}{r} &= K \\
2FK &= Kr \\
F_{e} &= \frac{Kr}{2K} \\
F_{e} &= \frac{r}{2}
\end{align*}

Then we substitute equation # and # into equation # to obtain the equilibrium yield,
